Extreme Programming (XP) is a new programming discipline, or methodology, that is geared toward the way that the vast majority of software development projects are handled -- in small teams. In this new book, noted software engineers Kent Beck and Martin Fowler show the reader how to properly plan a software development project with XP in mind. The authors lay out a proven strategy that forces the reader to plan as their software project unfolds, and therefore avoid many of the nasty problems that can potentially spring up along the way.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0201710919"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780201710915"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":162,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":6,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.2.4.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u13hVoYVZa8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u13hVoYVZa8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books?id=u13hVoYVZa8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=programming&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books?id=u13hVoYVZa8C&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Planning_Extreme_Programming.html?hl=&id=u13hVoYVZa8C"},"saleInfo":{"country":"EG","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"EG","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=u13hVoYVZa8C&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"In this new book, noted software engineers Kent Beck and Martin Fowler show the reader how to properly plan a software development project with XP in mind."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"pXDzdJ_1E3oC","etag":"kX0PbALYeTs","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/pXDzdJ_1E3oC","volumeInfo":{"title":"Practical C++ Programming","authors":["Steve Oualline"],"publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","publishedDate":"2003","description":"Teaches the programming language, covering topics including syntax, coding standards, object classes, templates, debugging, and the C++ preprocessor.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780596004194"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0596004192"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":574,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":19,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.4.0.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pXDzdJ_1E3oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pXDzdJ_1E3oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books?id=pXDzdJ_1E3oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=programming&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books?id=pXDzdJ_1E3oC&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Practical_C++_Programming.html?hl=&id=pXDzdJ_1E3oC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"EG","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"EG","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=pXDzdJ_1E3oC&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Practical C++ Programming thoroughly covers: C++ syntax · Coding standards and style · Creation and use of object classes · Templates · Debugging and optimization · Use of the C++ preprocessor · File input/output"}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"BOyCSAAACAAJ","etag":"U2ry7HARhwk","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/BOyCSAAACAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Python Programming","subtitle":"An Introduction to Computer Science","authors":["John M.
